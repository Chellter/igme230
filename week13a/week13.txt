Week 13a

My landing page:
There were no errors. My single feature was an image of me that I had labelled with the alternative text "A picture of me". I now know that it would be better if I labelled it "me".

RIT Housing Operations portal:
There are 23 errors. 9 images, 4 linked images, and an image button are missing alternative text.

9 forms are missing labels.
